## Developement
I will work on this in my spare time as it is not something I need urgently. If you have any suggestion or question, you can [reach me](mailto:contact@icybow.com).
This project will also be used for me to work on my *native JS* skills, so there will be no or very few external libraries. I am also not a big designer and it is not a very serious project that I am not even sure I will use productively (an Excel sheet does exactly the same(I already have it with all history)), but if you feel like improving the design (or anything else), feel free to do so.
